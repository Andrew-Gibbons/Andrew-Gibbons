I am currently working on Coursera classes while doing independent projects to showcase to employers.

All of the work in these repositories are from college coursework.  I scored 100% on nearly all assignments.

At this time I am working through a Murach's HTML/CSS project with JavaScript projects to follow.

After that I have a book about Ai in Web Development that has a project written in Python that I would like to complete.
